# numericalMethods
A compilation of working numerical methods in python.

These are the methods that are working up until now:
- Bisection
- LU
- Fake Ruler
- Gauss Jordan
- Lagrange Interpolation
- Quadratic roots

Most of these are used the same, we create an object of the class specified in
the file, and use the method Solve to obtain the expeted answer, some of them
still require a ''full solution'', for example LU gives us the L matrix and
still requires to be solved in another method (however, once we got L solving
the system is a piece of cake)

I encourage you to have a look at the files, they are quite interesting and
"easy to understand" however, I will try to make more comprehensive guides and
explanations for each method. right now this is just a compilation of usable
methods, you are supposed to use them more than learn them here.
